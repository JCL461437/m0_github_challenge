# GitHub Steps

Describe in your own words how to establish a connection between a local repository and a remote repository on GitHub.

To establish a connection between a local repository and a remote repository on GitHub you must first fork the original repository you wish to connect with locally by clicking the fork button. 

Now you will need to clone the repository onto your machine. To do this you must click the arrow button next the green code button, ensure SSH is selected, and then copy the link given to you. From there paste it after the following command in your terminal: 'git remote add origin []'.
